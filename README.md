## About
**NotYetAnotherNightshade** (NYAN) is a graph variational encoder as described in the manuscript "Variational graph encoders: a surprisingly effective generalist algorithm for holistic computer-aided drug design".

It allows for the embedding of molecules into a continuous latent space, and subsequent surrogate model training for molecular property prediction not limited to drug design and other chemistry applications.

The latent space method as described can also be used to perform highly accelerated, very high throughput virtual screening for computer-aided drug discovery of up to a few billion compounds.

The contents of this repository allows for the training of new encoders, construction of surrogate models, and latent space potentiation as described in the manuscript.
